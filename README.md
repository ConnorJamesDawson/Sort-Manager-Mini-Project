## Sorting Methods

### HeapSort Method

The Heap Sorting method works by arranging an array into a binary tree, with the largest value at the root of the tree. 

Then a Loop is made counting backwards from the Length of the array, assigning the root number (the largest) to the last value of the array and then making the rest of the array into another heap recursively until the array is sorted.
